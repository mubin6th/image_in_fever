<h1>image_in_<i>fever</i> <code>(iif)</code></h1>

`iif`, a tool to convert any image to a warm and eye-appealing image.
`iif` uses a technic known as image quantization, a way to limit
image's total color range. By doing so, we can choose specific colors
and represent the original image with those colors. In `iif`, I've
selected a set of sepia colors and extended the
[gruvbox-material](https://github.com/sainnhe/gruvbox-material)
colorscheme.
